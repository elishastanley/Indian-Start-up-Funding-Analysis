# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to

\"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In
this project, you are going to analyse funding received by start-ups in
India from 2018 to 2021. You will find the data for each year of funding
in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files you\'ll
