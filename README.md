# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to
flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other
entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as
\"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In
this project, you are going to analyse funding received by start-ups in
India from 2018 to 2021. You will find the data for each year of funding
in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files you\'ll
find the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the
investors\' information.

Title: Analysis of Start-Up Funding Trends in India (2018-2021)

Project Description:
This project aims to analyze the funding trends of Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021. By examining the data on start-up funding across these years, the project will identify key patterns, investment behaviors, and emerging sectors within the Indian start-up ecosystem. The analysis will provide insights into the types of industries receiving the most investment, the most active investors, the average funding amounts, and the geographical distribution of funded start-ups. The findings will guide strategic decisions for entering the Indian start-up market.

**Hypothesis:**  
• **Null Hypothesis (H0)**:
The total funding amount received by Indian start-ups has not significantly increased from 2018 to 2021.  
•** Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**:
The total funding amount received by Indian start-ups has significantly increased from 2018 to 2021.

Key Questions:

1. What is the year-on-year growth in total funding received by Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021?
2. Which industries have received the most funding in each year, and how has this distribution changed over time?
3. Who are the top investors in Indian start-ups during these years, and what are their investment patterns?
4. What are the average funding amounts for different funding stages (e.g., Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.) each year?
5. How is the geographical distribution of funded start-ups across India, and are there any emerging start-up hubs outside of the traditional metros?
